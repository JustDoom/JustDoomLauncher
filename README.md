# JustDoomLauncher

JustDoom Launcher is a custom launcher for my projects, 
they will be kept up to date and you will be able to install 
whichever version you want. The launcher is made with JavaFX and
Java 17. It also will install any dependencies required without
breaking any pre-installed ones on your machine (hopefully).

In the future I may add accounts for leaderboards in any games
that I create or for paid games.

This used my custom API for the projects 
(https://api.imjustdoom.com/projects). Coming Soon

Installation files, it includes the correct version of Java.
Create a new folder and extract the files there. Then run the
JustDoomLauncher.exe file. It will ask you to install the latest
version, accept it to get access to the latest changes.
